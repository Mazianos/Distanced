## About
This Transit like mobile-first web-application is for portfolio and not for release or monetize.

## Why we created this app
We created this app as our first project using programming skills that we were learning alongside such as basic HTML, CSS, JS, and data structure using firebase. At the time we started this project, covid-19 was on the rampage in Vancouver, but a lot of people still had to use public transports by various reasons.If we could know when the transits are crowded or not, still considering the fastest, average and slowest route, people could reduce the risk to get in touch with other passengers and manage their time at the same time.
	
## UI Design
To show a map on the web, we embedded google map and to draw a route we used "google.maps.Polyline".
As for user sign-in, we used firebase authentication.
